# System Setup
The aim is to create scripts for freshly installed Windows10, MacOS or Linux based machines.
The script will then automatically install all nescessary programs and tweak the system in order
to have a great (development) experience afterwards. 

## TL;DR
Turn (my or)your system from frehsly native into tweaked including all nescessary programs installed by 
only run one script. 

## Disclaimer
I write these scripts for personale use. So they do the stuff reflecting 
my opinion about a great tweaked and set up computer. Feel free to
adjust or don't use the scripts at all. Feedback is very welcome!


## Features 
- Windows 10 script (windows10.ps1) -> in progress
- Linux based -> not yet implemented
- MacOS -> not yet implemented


## How to use it
